Assignment: #1

The required pages have all been uploaded to github so that they have the correct URLs.
There are seven rules in the stylesheet being used. 
All pages have been made; although, I admit the bio is a little derivative and short.

David Bernstein helped with getting my pages to be at the correct URL.

The assignment took about 2 hours, not including background research that I did on CSS files before the class on them.
